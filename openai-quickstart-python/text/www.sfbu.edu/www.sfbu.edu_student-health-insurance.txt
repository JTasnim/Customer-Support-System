Student Health Insurance





Student Health Insurance





















All students must have health insurance coverage for each term they are enrolled in and during semester breaks. Students enrolled in a 100% online modality are exempt from this health insurance requirement. Beginning September 1, 2024, SFBU offers international students health insurance coverage through Cigna Healthcare via International Student Insurance.
Domestic students seeking health coverage are encouraged to visit the following website to identify options, www.ehealthinsurance.com.

Students with Pre-Existing Health Insurance
If you have valid U.S. health insurance, and you do not qualify to purchase health insurance through SFBU (must be an international student), your insurance plan documents may be uploaded to your portal before or after you register for courses.

About the Insurance Plan - for International Students only
The SFBU student Health insurance plan is offered through International Student Insurance and is administered by Cigna Healthcare. The plan includes large networks of doctors and pharmacies, and focuses on easy use for all members. When you visit a participating healthcare provider or pharmacy, show your ID card, and they will file all claim forms for you.
Please refer to Cigna Health Policy at a Glance for more information. You can learn more about your plan and access your policy documents through your online Student Zone here.
Enrolled students can find a complete list of healthcare providers and pharmacies by visiting the provider directory. To find providers, log in to your Cigna Envoy account, or visit www.cigna.com and follow these steps:

Select ‚ÄúEmployer or School‚Äù.
Enter address, city, or zip code, and then choose doctor type, by name, or facility.
Click ‚ÄúContinue as Guest.‚Äù
Click on ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù.
Choose the Open Access Plus Network.
View search results.

You must pay a $20 copay for in-network doctor visits, a $50 copay for in-network urgent care centers, and a $200 copay for in-network emergency room treatment, at the time of the visit. Please refer to the policy wording to learn more about any out-of-pocket expenses included in your plan.
For medicine prescriptions, you must pay a $30 copay for generic drugs, a $60 copay for preferred brand-name drugs, and a $100 copay for non-preferred brand-name drugs. The SFBU Student Health Insurance Plan brochure has more information about the prescription medication coverage included in your plan, and you can also contact Cigna with any questions about your prescriptions.
To visit the insurer home page and create your Cigna Envoy account, please visit your Student Zone for more information. Through your Cigna Envoy account, you will be able to file a new claim online, check the status of an existing claim, access Telemedicine, and more.
Important Note: All SFBU new students must review the Health Requirements information.
