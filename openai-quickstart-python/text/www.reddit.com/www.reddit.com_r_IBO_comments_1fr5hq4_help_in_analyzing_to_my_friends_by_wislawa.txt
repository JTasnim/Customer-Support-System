       Help in Analyzing “To My Friends” by Wislawa Szymborska  






    Group 1
  








    Hi everyone. I’m an SL literature student and one of the major assignments we have is to analyze one of szymborska’s poems and identify how the author utilizes literary devices to create meaning. I am aware of the author’s reputation which is why I was surprised to find essentially 0 online interpretations, critiques, or analyses of this specific poem. Could you guys please help me analyze the poem? Specifically, I am looking for:
  


    Literal + figurative meaning of the poem
  


    8-10 authorial choices that szymborska uses to create the figurative + literal meaning.
  


    Here is a picture of the poem. Don’t mind the annotations, they are just my notes form when I attempted to decipher it on my own.
  
    Thanks for the help.
