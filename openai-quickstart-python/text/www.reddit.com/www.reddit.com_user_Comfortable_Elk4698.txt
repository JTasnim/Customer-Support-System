    Do you have a link to the foundation and does it cover “to my friends”? I spent like an hour just looking for some mention of the poem online and found nothing so anything would be helpful!

     Help in Analyzing “To My Friends” by Wislawa Szymborska 
  





    Group 1
  








    Hi everyone. I’m an SL literature student and one of the major assignments we have is to analyze one of szymborska’s poems and identify how the author utilizes literary devices to create meaning. I am aware of the author’s reputation which is why I was surprised to find essentially 0 online interpretations, critiques, or analyses of this specific poem. Could you guys please help me analyze the poem? Specifically, I am looking for:
  


    Literal + figurative meaning of the poem
  


    8-10 authorial choices that szymborska uses to create the figurative + literal meaning.
  


    Here is a picture of the poem. Don’t mind the annotations, they are just my notes form when I attempted to decipher it on my own.
  
    Thanks for the help.
