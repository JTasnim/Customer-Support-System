Here's a VR cave exploration game called "Caved In" that I've been working on that plays on your sense of claustraphobia.

Tokyo VR game?

     Tokyo VR game? 
  





    Question
  








    Hello everyone I apologize if this isn't the correct spot to ask this. My brother-in-law is entering end of life care due to aggressive cancer and has always dreamed of going to Tokyo and visiting Your Name Stairway. Apparently it's big in the anime he likes. He was supposed to visit Tokyo this spring but with his recent diagnosis that isn't an option.
  
    Is there a game/experience that takes place in Tokyo? Perhaps even with the stairway itself? Im not a VR guy myself so am completely lost in where to begin. Any help pointing us in the right direction? Thanks.
