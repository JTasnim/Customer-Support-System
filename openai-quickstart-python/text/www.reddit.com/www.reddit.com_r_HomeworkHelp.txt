     [Calculus 1 Derivatives] Confused as to why my answer is wrong? 







 Further Mathematics
  









    Problem: ( The¬†x¬†y¬†coordinate plane is given. The curve enters the window at the point¬†(‚àí5, 0),¬†goes up and right to the open point¬†(‚àí3, 4),¬†and goes down and right to the closed point¬†(0, 1).¬†The curve starts again at the open point (0,¬†‚àí1), goes up and right to the open point¬†(2, 2),¬†and then oscillates at an increasing rate between¬†y¬†= 2¬†and¬†y¬†= 4¬†until it reaches the¬†x-value of 5. Between the¬†x-values of 4.5 and 5 the oscillations are too close together to distinguish individual curves. At (5, 3) the oscillations stop and the curve goes up and right, changes direction at the approximate point¬†(7, 4.8),¬†goes down and right, and exits the window in the second quadrant. )

    Answer -> Reasoning: As x approaches 5 from the Left side, Y approaches 5.
