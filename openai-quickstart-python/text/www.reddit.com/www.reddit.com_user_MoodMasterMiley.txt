     Tokyo VR game?  






    Question
  








    Hello everyone I apologize if this isn't the correct spot to ask this. My brother-in-law is entering end of life care due to aggressive cancer and has always dreamed of going to Tokyo and visiting Your Name Stairway. Apparently it's big in the anime he likes. He was supposed to visit Tokyo this spring but with his recent diagnosis that isn't an option.
  
    Is there a game/experience that takes place in Tokyo? Perhaps even with the stairway itself? Im not a VR guy myself so am completely lost in where to begin. Any help pointing us in the right direction? Thanks.

Hells Canyon Trip Questions







MoodMasterMiley









  
    
   commented








    Hells guide here. Sept can be weird in the canyon. As others have said the water is warm but ANY weather pattern that rolls through will make things miserable without proper wet gear. If you have raft support bring both a dry suit and splash gear. Seriously don't underestimate the weather out here.

    Everyone mentions the port in Lewiston but no one mentions nothing is shipped out of there anymore, it's all by rail. That 'port' has been dying and laying off people for years.
