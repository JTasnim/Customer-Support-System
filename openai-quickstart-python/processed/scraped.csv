I’ve never read any John Updike before, but I have read a ton of what I would consider “dude lit,” even though I’m a straight woman. I love Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Bret Easton Ellis, etc. But this John Updike guy? I just don’t know about him.  I’m reading The Villages, which maybe isn’t a great place to start, but I just really don’t like how Updike writes about women and sex. It’s like he has no empathy for his female characters, at all, it’s like they’re just sex-puppets to him. And this is coming from someone who loves Bret Easton Ellis! Who has sawed his female characters in half! Hemingway, who has knocked up several poor long-suffering nurses and abandoned them! Steinbeck, who has given us so many drunken louts who let down the women in their lives.  I don’t know why Updike’s suburban, milquetoast misogyny bothers me so much! I guess it’s this pervasive belief that his characters seem to have that women are so “different” so “exotic and unknowable.” It’s like, they are just women, like, half the people on the planet, like your own mom and sister. Why does he write about them like they are another species?  I was going to read Rabbit, Run, but now I’m just too skeeved out. Does it handle its female characters well? Is it worth reading?

My brother-in-law is entering end of life care due to aggressive cancer and has always dreamed of going to Tokyo and visiting Your Name Stairway. Apparently it's big in the anime he likes. He was supposed to visit Tokyo this spring but with his recent diagnosis that isn't an option.  Is there a game/experience that takes place in Tokyo? Perhaps even with the stairway itself? Im not a VR guy myself so am completely lost in where to begin. Any help pointing us in the right direction? Thanks.         r/whitewater      Welcome to r/whitewater!

I’m an SL literature student and one of the major assignments we have is to analyze one of szymborska’s poems and identify how the author utilizes literary devices to create meaning. I am aware of the author’s reputation which is why I was surprised to find essentially 0 online interpretations, critiques, or analyses of this specific poem. Could you guys please help me analyze the poem? Specifically, I am looking for:   Literal + figurative meaning of the poem   8-10 authorial choices that szymborska uses to create the figurative + literal meaning.   Here is a picture of the poem. Don’t mind the annotations, they are just my notes form when I attempted to decipher it on my own.  Thanks for the help.

Further Mathematics     Problem: ( The x y coordinate plane is given. The curve enters the window at the point (−5, 0), goes up and right to the open point (−3, 4), and goes down and right to the closed point (0, 1). The curve starts again at the open point (0, −1), goes up and right to the open point (2, 2), and then oscillates at an increasing rate between y = 2 and y = 4 until it reaches the x-value of 5. Between the x-values of 4.5 and 5 the oscillations are too close together to distinguish individual curves. At (5, 3) the oscillations stop and the curve goes up and right, changes direction at the approximate point (7, 4.8), goes down and right, and exits the window in the second quadrant. ) https://preview.redd.it/calculus-1-derivatives-confused-as-to-why-my-answer-is-wrong-v0-psocvfiq6gsd1.png  Answer -> Reasoning: As x approaches 5 from the Left side, Y approaches 5. https://preview.redd.it/calculus-1-derivatives-confused-as-to-why-my-answer-is-wrong-v0-hhw6cbcc8gsd1.png   [Algebra 9th] help  u/PhraseEfficient7935     ADMIN    MOD  •        [Algebra 9th] help   High School Math          [University Computer Science: If Statements Lab] How do I populate the formula automatically?  u/ScienceNerd1001001     ADMIN    MOD  •        [University Computer Science: If Statements Lab] How do I populate the formula automatically?

Developer          Tokyo VR game?  u/MoodMasterMiley     ADMIN    MOD  •        Tokyo VR game?    Question    Hello everyone I apologize if this isn't the correct spot to ask this. My brother-in-law is entering end of life care due to aggressive cancer and has always dreamed of going to Tokyo and visiting Your Name Stairway. Apparently it's big in the anime he likes. He was supposed to visit Tokyo this spring but with his recent diagnosis that isn't an option.  Is there a game/experience that takes place in Tokyo? Perhaps even with the stairway itself? Im not a VR guy myself so am completely lost in where to begin. Any help pointing us in the right direction? Thanks.

I’m an SL literature student and one of the major assignments we have is to analyze one of szymborska’s poems and identify how the author utilizes literary devices to create meaning. I am aware of the author’s reputation which is why I was surprised to find essentially 0 online interpretations, critiques, or analyses of this specific poem. Could you guys please help me analyze the poem? Specifically, I am looking for:   Literal + figurative meaning of the poem   8-10 authorial choices that szymborska uses to create the figurative + literal meaning.   Here is a picture of the poem. Don’t mind the annotations, they are just my notes form when I attempted to decipher it on my own.
