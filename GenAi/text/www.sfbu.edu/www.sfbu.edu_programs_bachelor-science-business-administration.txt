        Elective Coursework
      




A minimum of 24 units of elective coursework promotes a breadth of knowledge, in addition to the depth of the degree program. Electives may include courses from the School of Business, the School of Engineering, courses bearing graduate level credit, and transferable undergraduate-level courses. Please note that prerequisites and corequisites must be met. (A prerequisite is a course that must be taken before registering for another course; a corequisite is a course that must be taken at the same time as another course.)
When applicable, students may take curricular practicum training (CPT) to earn credit for internship-based projects directly related to their course of study.
We encourage business students interested in pursuing business administration as a profession to take additional management and marketing courses. Those who are more interested in information science careers might consider computer science (CS) courses from the School of Engineering. We also encourage them to take BLAW482: Information Policy, Governance, and Compliance, and IT electives such as BAN455: Server-Side Data Processing Using Python/PHP.
Business students considering a future career as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) should seek additional advising upon matriculation. The California Board of Accountancy requires substantial education and training beyond the scope of the business administration bachelor’s program. We encourage students to review the CBA’s numerous requirements and focus all elective and General Education coursework towards meeting them, where possible. 








        Optional Concentration in Business Analytics
      




In addition to earning their bachelor’s, students can pursue an official concentration in business analytics by completing 12 applicable units (typically 4 courses).
We advise students to complete the required coursework before meeting with the Registrar's Office. Even if the student has earned sufficient units, their official transcript will not reflect the concentration until they submit a formal request.
Due to logistics, last-minute concentration requests and changes may not be approved at the discretion of the Registrar's Office.
Students can apply the following courses to the business analytics concentration:

BAN223: SQL & Relational Databases
BAN335: Python Introduction for Commerce
BAN337: JavaScript
BAN452: Excel for Finance, Accounting & Analytics
BAN455: Server-Side Data Processing Using Python/PHPBAN460: Introduction to Business AnalyticsBAN460L: Introduction to Business Analytics LabBAN463: Data VisualizationBAN470: Introduction to Machine Learning Based Prediction Modeling and ForecastingBAN472: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)BAN501: Quantitative Methods for BusinessBAN520: Business Analytics for DashboardsBAN524: Intermediate Business AnalyticsBAN572: Process Management for AnalyticsBAN589: Special Topics on Analytics, Strategy, and Applied InformationMGT501: Agile Project ManagementMGT460: Production and Operations ManagementMGT460L: Production and Operations Management Lab
