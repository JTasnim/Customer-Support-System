Interested in making an important impact on other students' mental health? San Francisco Bay University has partnered with the Let's TALK program, an early preventative and intervention program that promotes conversation on mental well-being and active listening/support. You can become a Buddy (students) or Mentor (staff/faculty) and receive the training to hold conversations surrounding mental health. 
To become a Buddy/Mentor, you must attend a mandatory training session from Tuesday, October 29th to Wednesday, October 30th, from 9am-5pm both days in the Student Success Hub Multi-purpose room.
