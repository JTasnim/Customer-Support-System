        Business Management Certificate Curriculum Overview
      




Of the 18 units needed to earn the certificate, only six are required. Students choose two of the following three core business courses to fulfill this requirement: Financial Management (3), Human Resource Management (3), Logistics and Operations Management (3). Students complete the remaining units through MBA-acceptable coursework.
Because our admissions process is open and inclusive, the individual takes responsibility for determining their readiness and aptitude for success. Thus, we do not enforce prerequisites or corequisites for certificate students.
