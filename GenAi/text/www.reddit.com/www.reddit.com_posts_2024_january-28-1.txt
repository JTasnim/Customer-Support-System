            Trivia: The 1985 film Better Off Dead is based on the director's life as a teen. Six years after the movie came out, the director said he got a call from his ex-girlfriend who said she'd been in therapy because she saw his movie and had no idea how much she had hurt him. She then sent him cookies.

r/WitchesVsPatriarchy












r/WitchesVsPatriarchy







              r/WitchesVsPatriarchy is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic.

The goal is to at once embrace, and poke fun at, the mystical aspects of femininity that have been previously demonized and/or devalued by the patriarchy.

This subreddit is a Safe Space for Women, BIPOC, and anyone in the LGBTQ+ community. We are Sisters, not Cisters. If you do not consider yourself an ally, then this subreddit is not for you.
