     Passive skill tree enchants drop to normal after combining. 






    Question
  








    Like the title says, I'm using the passive skill tree mod (simply skills for forge), and the enchanter skills allow for enchants not normally possible (i.e prot 8, sharp 8, unb 5.) However, combining these reset it back to normal. What I mean is, if I had a prot 8 book, and a unb 5 chestplate, putting the book on the chestplate will set the prot 8 to prot 5, but keep the unb. combining two chestplates resets everything, and combining two books resets everything to vanilla levels. Could somebody please suggest a solution to this? Thank you.

    As the title says, I'm having trouble with server land protections, and I need a claiming mod that can be easily managed by server operators, and optionally a cost for land claiming. Thanks
