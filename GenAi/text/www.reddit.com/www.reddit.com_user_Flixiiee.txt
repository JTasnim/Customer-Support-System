    You should concentrate more on your crosshair placement. You were aiming very close to the edge of the exit. If someone comes out of there now, you hardly have time to react. Place your crosshair a little further to the right. This should make it easier for you to hit your opponent, as he won't simply run through your crosshair.

    WÃ¤re es nicht sinniger mit einem Startkapital anzufangen welches fÃ¼r dich realistisch ist? Von 100.000 auf 1.000.000 ist deutlich deutlich einfacher als von z.b 2.000â‚¬

Ive got this old Sony CCD-TR502E from my Dad. I already saw the pinned post "How do I get my tapes onto my computer?" but my Cam has only 2 Outputs. The Audio L/R is like in one piece. I only see Video Grabber with Audio L/R inputs. Can I just use these? Thanks for the answers my fellow cam enjoyers
