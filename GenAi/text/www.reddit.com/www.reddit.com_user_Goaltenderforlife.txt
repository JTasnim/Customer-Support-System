    Seeking Advice
  








    Like the title says Iâ€™m looking to make a change. I would like something where I can take my skills and utilize them along side engineers developing medical technology/devices.
  
    Does anyone know of career paths or jobs where a bedside RN can successfully get into this field without having to go back to school?

    I live in west Michigan, where there is considerable lake affect snow throughout the winter. This was my first winter season and it did fine with stock tires. I do plan on getting a set of steel rims with winter tires in the future though.

Why did you become a goalie?

    During mini mites league and mites league everyone got the chance to play goalie. I had a knack for it. Went to goalie full time first year squirts. Something about being in a position thatâ€™s looked at as either the hero of the game or the loser of the game. Still play menâ€™s league to this day.

    I donâ€™t cover my legs either. Bare feet in the skates, briefs and a t-shirt. Thatâ€™s it.

    These two were the hardest to sit through. Around the tendons and lateral parts of the thigh were brutal. Then there were a couple times when the artist was pushing down it reflex area, it wasnâ€™t painful but awkward feeling.
  
    I have the front of my thigh and knee cap done and I think those were easier to sit through.
