              PTCM is a hub for sharing above average, planned video camera operation; capturing calculated recording angles; maintaining good camera control, general perception, also properly controlling what's in the frame. 

Interesting content is not necessarily a solid ground for giving praise regardless of how good the content is on its own.

              A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

              this is a community like r/AmITheAsshole except unlike that subreddit here you can post interpersonal conflicts, anything that's AITA but is not allowed there even posting about Scar from the lion king and trying to convince redditors that he was not the AH.

rules: don't berate others and no pornography we have children here

              A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

            In the movie Police Academy, when cadet Leslie Barbara points the shotgun at the other cadets, the only one who doesn't duck is Tackleberry. This is because he is a gun lover and knows the shotgun hadn't been cocked and a shell wasn't in the chamber, so it couldn't be fired
