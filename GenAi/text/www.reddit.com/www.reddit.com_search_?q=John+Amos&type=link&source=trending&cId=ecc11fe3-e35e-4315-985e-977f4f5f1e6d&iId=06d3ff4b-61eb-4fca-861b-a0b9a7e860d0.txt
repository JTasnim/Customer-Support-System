RIP John Amos, he passed away today at age 84. Admiral Fitzwallace was one of the most underrated characters in the entire West Wing series.

              Generation X was born, by broadest definition, between 1961 and 1981, the greatest anti-child cycle in modern history. Nevertheless, we grew up to become the world's most devoted parents: the "workhorse of America." This sub welcomes links, photos, 
graphics, memoirs, commentaries, 
stories, etc., for and about Gen-Xers, the 13th Generation of Americans.  GenX also translates to many other parts of the world.
