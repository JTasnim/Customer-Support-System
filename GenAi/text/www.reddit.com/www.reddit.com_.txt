Davante Adams trade rumors 

          The Jets and Cowboys are among the many teams monitoring the Davante Adams situation. Both have checked in with the Raiders. I’m told at this point that Vegas is in no rush to make a move until a team reaches their asking price — but Adams wants out ASAP.

     Is it a red flag if the guy I'm dating admires Andrew Tate? 







    I've been dating this guy for a while, and everything seemed great until a recent date when he mentioned he's a fan of Andrew Tate. He actively listens to Tate's podcasts and aligns with many of his views, although he claims to disagree with Tate's opinions about women. This revelation has left me concerned, as I've only encountered Tate through brief social media clips and fundamentally disagree with his ideology. Could this be a major red flag? What are your thoughts?

    My dream has been Star Wars: The Old Republic, but I have no idea what the status of the remake is. So I'm going with Jade Empire.
