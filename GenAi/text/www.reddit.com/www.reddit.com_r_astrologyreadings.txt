 Rules





1



                No spam
              














2



            Be nice and considerate. If you're giving advice in this sub, be very careful what you write.
          

















    Basic Net-etiquette, but with an astrological tone.
  













3



            No  Synastry (Synastry is compatibility), Composite or "Guess My Sign" selfies
          

















    Synastry is forbidden unless a direct family member. It's a crapshoot otherwise. "Guess my sign" is narcissistic and cheapens the spirit of the sub.
  













4



            No solicitation
          

















    No soliciting paid readings, no free readings or other. (Don't offer readings in this subreddit - we read from the charts publicly in the posts)
  













5



            No Asteroid readings (Chiron, begone!)
          

















    Asteroids, including Chiron have been known about for a few hundred years, but were never considered as having astral influence. Ask about them in the other subs, please.
  













6



            Ban evasion
          

















    Creation of alt to get around ban.
  













7



            Narcissistic, Vapid, Drama-ME-ME-ME
          

















    Vapid post.
  













8



            No derails
          

















    Also basic etiquette about derailing a topic
  













9



            No AI generated replies or copy paste interps
          

















    Anyone can go to ChatGPT or Gemini and get a generic answer. The beauty of the sub is that people who post their chart can get creatively inspired responses that doesn’t have the look and feel of chatting with a bot. The same goes for copy pasted answers.
  













10



            Posting another's chart without permission 
          

















    Posting another's chart without permission is not allowed
