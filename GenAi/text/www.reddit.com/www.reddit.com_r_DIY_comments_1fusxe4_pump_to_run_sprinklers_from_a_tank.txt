       Pump to run sprinklers from a tank?
    





    help
  








    I have a handful of 256 gallon water tanks around my land that we use for animals and irrigation. I got a little 12v battery powered transfer pump and it works ok if I'm just filling ponds but if I want to hook it up to a sprinkler it doesn't seem to create enough pressure to get the water out of the sprinklers very well. Harbor Freight has some pumps one with a pressure tank and one that just for sprinklers.
  
    I'm also looking for a backup in case our well pump fails and I have to use one of the tanks to supply the house.
