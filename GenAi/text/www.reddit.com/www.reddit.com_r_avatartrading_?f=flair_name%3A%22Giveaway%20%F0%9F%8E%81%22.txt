3



            Stay Safe and Do NOT Shorten URLs
          



















    Do not interact with random NFTs or tokens that appear in your wallet - a good practice is to ask about the same in the sub

7

    Third party products require review and approval from the mod team (Please modmail us about the same)
  


    Approved third party products do not automatically mean mod endorsement. The team disclaims any liability in this regard
  


    Please use caution when connecting your wallet to approved Third Party Products and proceed at your own risk
  















10



            Crossposts for Shilling and Brigading
          



















    Crossposts cannot be used to shill crypto or advertise/promote products not related to avatars
  


    Crossposts cannot be used to brigade other communities
  















11



            No AI Generated Art
