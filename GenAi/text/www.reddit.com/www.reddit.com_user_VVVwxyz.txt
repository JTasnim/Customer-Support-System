     Good book scanner for photo books
  





    Question/Advice
  








    Does anyone have recommendations for a good (especially budget) book scanners, that are good for photo books that are at least 10" in height? Is a regular book scanner good for scanning photo books? Are there any alternatives to scanning photo books with just a regular scanner?
