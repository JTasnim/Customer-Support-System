 Rules










1



            Rule 1 - Respect
          

















    Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.
  













2



            Rule 2 - Future Focus
          

















    Submissions must be future focused. All posts must have an initial comment, a Submission Statement, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future. AI-focused posts are only allowed on the weekend.
  













3



            Rule 3 - Images
          

















    No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.
  













4



            Rule 4 - Petitions, Polls, and Fundraising
          

















    No spamming - this includes polls, surveys, and self-promotion.
  








5



                Rule 5 - Bots require moderator permission to operate
              














6



            Rule 6 - Comment Quality
          

















    Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.
  













7



            Rule 7 - Account age
          

















    Account age: >1 day to comment, >5 days to submit content
  













8



            Rule 8 - Negative Karma
          

















    Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed
  













9



            Rule 9 - No Duplicates
          

















    Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.
  













10



            Rule 10 - In Depth
          

















    Submissions with [in-depth] in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines.
  













11



            Rule 11 - Title Quality
          

















    Titles should accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission.
  













12



            Rule 12 - Original Sources
          

















    Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content. AI generated text does not qualify as an original source.
  













13



            Rule 13 - Content age
          

















    Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title.
  






 


On Futurology



If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called "future(s)" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 
One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.
