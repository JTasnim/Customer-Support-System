My phone sound recorder seems to have automated gain control, which when listening to the recordings on higher volume sounds a bit distracting and also doesn't allow me to apply noise reduction. Can anyone help me on what compressor settings I should use to make the audio sound better?

    My friends son was kidnapped and we have an audio recording of the kidnappers talking about how they got him to lie about wanting to stay with them. It's a woman speaking Spanish in the background but the only issue is it's hard to hear. Could someone please help me tweak the audio to hear her better? ðŸ˜ž
