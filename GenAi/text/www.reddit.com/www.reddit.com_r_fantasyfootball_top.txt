#Lions HC Dan Campbell on David Montgomery: “This guy is unbelievable. The play is never over with him. He’s a strong runner. He can will himself to make things happen, and he’s tough, he’s relentless, he’s resilient, he’s everything you want in a back.”

Contest Thank You



 


 Rules










1



            No individual threads of any kind specific to your team or league.
          

















    Threads devoted to individualized advice (lineup decisions, roster moves, trades, league issues etc.) are posted multiple times a day. They can be found by following the links in the stickied INDEX thread on the front page.
  
    Posting or encouraging Rule 1 breaking content may result in a temporary ban.
  
    Stories, questions, and other media (e.g. "look at our league recap video!") about only your team or league will be removed.
  













2



            Don't post standalone Player/Game Discussion threads when a Game or Postgame Thread is active
          

















    Please keep all game-specific reactions within these threads while they are active. Only injury news and updates are allowed as standalone posts during gametime.
  













3



            Keep the subreddit on topic and quality up. No memes, irrelevant media or spam.
          

















    Player discussions must make a legitimate effort to prompt discussion that is useful for everyone.
  
    Not all NFL news/facts are directly relevant to fantasy football.
  
    When posting tweets, use the entire content of the tweet as the post title. Don't editorialize it.
  
    Read our self promotion rules before posting links to your own site/channel or a site/channel you are affiliated with.
  













4



            Search or check new before posting
          

















    Duplicate posts are a common reason for removal. We only need one submission per breaking news story and you’ll find many questions have been asked and answered many times over the years.
  













5



            Be respectful
          

















    Namecalling, any type of racism/sexism/homophobia or slur, harassment, personal attacks and comments in exceedingly poor taste (making light of sexual/child/domestic abuse, mass murder, etc) are strictly not allowed. This includes usernames and team names as well. No politics.
  
    Do not go back to old posts or comments to gloat/shame/mock or otherwise comment on others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.
  













6



            Avoid posting circlejerk or reaction threads
          

















    Hype trains, panic threads, and the like bring down quality. In general, keep discussion fantasy relevant instead of resorting to a bunch of catch phrases and memes for a player. Limit jokes in Player Discussion and Breaking News threads.
  
    The only standalone posts during an active game will be detailed/updated injury or analysis threads. Reaction threads will be removed.
  













7



            Report content that breaks the rules
          

















    We can't keep an eye on every single post and comment in the subreddit 24/7. Don't hesitate to contact the moderators for any reason.
  













8



            No posts about referral or premium content
          

















r/fantasyfootball is a place where people come together to share knowledge and insight. It is not a place for you to farm referrals to earn credit on daily fantasy sports sites. Additionally, we try to maintain good relationships with premium content providers and therefore any links to or requests for premium content that circumvent a site's paywall will be met with swift action.
  













9



            No "extreme" bets, wagers, etc
          

















    Over the last couple of years we've had several users make bold predictions and claim they'll back them up with "extreme" bets (e.g., drinking urine, eating a pet goldfish). These types of bets are not allowed here. We want to keep things fun, but not at the expense of eternal humiliation (YouTube videos do not go away) or at the expense of a living creature.
