              The best links to click while you're stoned!

Psychedelic, mindfucking, mesmerizing, reality-distorting or trippy games, video, audio & images that make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!

Come for mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness.

Reminder: This is not a "reaction subreddit".

              All things related to The Witcher - books, games, TV... You name it.

The Witcher is a critically acclaimed fantasy book series created by Andrzej Sapkowski. The series follows Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter in a universe where people often prove more wicked than beasts. Though originally written in Polish, the franchise gathered a large international following from likewise acclaimed game adaptions by CD Projekt. The books now translated into a dozen languages have also been adapted for TV.
