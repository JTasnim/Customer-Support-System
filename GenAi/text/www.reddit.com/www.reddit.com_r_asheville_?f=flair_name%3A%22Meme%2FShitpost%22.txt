 Rules










1



            Hate Speech or Insults
          



















    Calls to physical violence or cyberbullying against another person or organization will not be tolerated.
  


    Suicidal posts will be removed at moderator's discretion.
  


    Text that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or abilities, will not be tolerated.
  


    Demeaning or inflammatory language directed at other users will not be tolerated.
  


    If a user breaks any of these rules, the comment should be reported.
  















2



            Trolling
          

















    Comments or posts that are obviously shameless trolling may be removed. If trolling is the pattern of the account, the user may be banned. Trolling will be defined at the discretion of the mods. Inflammatory and digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages typically fall within the definition of trolling. In short, if you find yourself commenting just to rile up other users or because you know they won’t like it, you are trolling.
  













3



            Impersonating Another User
          

















    Impersonating another person or account is allowed, but only if it is obviously satire, and there is no attempt to convince people otherwise. If these rules are not followed, there could be a ban hammer waiting.
  













4



            Spam
          



















    A user who repetitively posts similar content within a short time frame in an effort to promote themselves or a specific cause, whether it be within the Asheville subreddit, or across the reddit platform, may be banned.
  















5



            Irrelevant Content
          



















    Subreddit content should be kept to centered around, located from, or make more than passing reference to Asheville, North Carolina, or areas in its vicinity. Some of these areas will always be relevant to Ashevillians, and some areas will are only sometimes relevant.
  


    The geographic areas that are allowed can be seen here: 



    Content that is irrelevant to the subreddit will be removed.
  















6



            Doxxing
          



















    Do not make calls to action directed at non-public persons. Users are not allowed to post information with the purposes of causing harm to or harassment of other people. This includes but is not limited to: names, telephone numbers, and street or email addresses. Seriously hinting knowledge of this information is also not allowed.
  


    Since it is usually impossible to verify the identity of an anonymous user, moderators will remove any specific addresses of individuals.
  















7



            Promotionals
          

















    This rule only applies for posts; no linking to GoFundMes, or other crowd-funding services. No posts linking specifically to money payment systems. Comments are fair game, but not posts.
  













8



            Visiting/Moving to Asheville?
          

















    We have a pinned visiting/moving thread that is refreshed every Monday for all questions about visiting or moving to Asheville. We receive numerous posts per day from prospective visitors/movers to the area and would like to keep all relevant discussion in the pinned thread. This includes asking for a friend/relative. Please feel free to repost your visiting/moving inquiries there if your post is removed.
