     Repairing dresser drawer stops/slides 






    help
  








    The plastic drawer stop broke on the back of my dresser drawer and I need to replace it. However, it looks like there are several different slide systems. How would one go about finding out which you have on an older dresser that is no longer available?  This is a broyhill pleasant Isle dresser. I can't seem to find any information about the slide system online.
  











Pump to run sprinklers from a tank?

     Pump to run sprinklers from a tank?
  





    help
  








    I have a handful of 256 gallon water tanks around my land that we use for animals and irrigation. I got a little 12v battery powered transfer pump and it works ok if I'm just filling ponds but if I want to hook it up to a sprinkler it doesn't seem to create enough pressure to get the water out of the sprinklers very well. Harbor Freight has some pumps one with a pressure tank and one that just for sprinklers.
  
    I'm also looking for a backup in case our well pump fails and I have to use one of the tanks to supply the house.
  











Underlayment Required for Gym Floor?

     Underlayment Required for Gym Floor?
  





    help
  








    Hey y'all, quick question.
  
    I have some horse stall mats I will be using as flooring for a home gym. Previously I had the home gym in the garage but I moved and now will have a dedicated room inside.
  
    Should I put any kind of underlayment on top of my existing flooring (laminate flooring, RevWood) before putting the mats on top to protect the floor? I'm worried about staining the floor underneath but don't want to cause moisture issues since laminate isn't water resistant.
  
    Thanks!

            Rating & Reviewing Products or Brands
          

















    This subreddit has a hard and fast set of rules against rating various manufacturers, and against reviews of products.
  
    In the early days of this sub, we were being hit multiple times a day by accounts that were basically shills. They’d promote various products under the guise of ‘I just used this and it’s great!’ Or they’d trash their competition by saying ‘Hope you don’t have the same experience I had with them’
  
    Therefore we decided that nothing/nobody was going to get rated/promoted.

            Sometimes you let the professionals handle it
          

















    Some things shouldn't be DIY.
  
    Anything where a professional is REQUIRED to perform/complete the task for reasons of :
  


    Safety
  


    Laws / bylaws
  


    Code enforcement
  


    Job Specific Certifications (Master Electrician, etc)
  


    Questions pertaining to these should not be asked in r/DIY. Go ask a professional / get a pro to handle it.
  
    Don't Ask:
  


    Is this?: Dangerous | Mold | Asbestos | etc
  


    If you followed all the codes, laws or are a certified pro who has completed a project, you are free to share.
