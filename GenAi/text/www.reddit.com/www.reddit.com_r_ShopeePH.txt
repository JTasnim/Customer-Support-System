    Looking For
  








    Hi! Ano marerecommend niyo na shoes na worth less than 3k?
  
    For context, I'll use it for work (BPO), polo shirt kasi ang uniform namin so I usually pair it with either trousers or skirts.
  
    Here are the shoes that I currently have:
  


    Converse Chuck 70
  


    Adidas Lifestyle Grand Court
