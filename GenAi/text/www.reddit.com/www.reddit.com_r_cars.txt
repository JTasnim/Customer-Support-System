 Rules










1



            No Incivility or illegality
          

















    Comments cannot be excessively argumentative, insulting, gatekeeping, threadjacking, or otherwise generally uncivil; this includes comments about demographics and other drivers. Do not escalate with, harass, or stalk other users.
  
    Sexism, racism, slurs, etc. will NOT be tolerated. This extends to usernames.
  
    Incitements to violence or criminal behavior (e.g. reckless driving, hot smog, vandalism, fraud, etc.) will result in an immediate ban.
  













2



            No direct image or video posts
          

















    Create a text post that includes the link and your thoughts on the subject - if you think a video is worth sharing, you have to share your thoughts, too. Remember to flair your post as a video. For car identification, please use r/whatisthiscar, r/namethatcar or r/rbi.
  













3



            No ads/spam/blogspam
          

















    Absolutely no promotional posts, advertising, blogspam, link farming, etc. Spamming is cause for an immediate ban and domain/channel blacklisting.
  
Rules on self-promotion

    If you're submitting a curious classified ad as a discussion starter, please write about what caught your eye. Ads must be mirrored (not linked to the original).
  
    All links (including YouTube) must be submitted as link posts.
  
    Avoid agenda spamming.
  













4



            If you make a clickbait/cryptic post, mods may choose to mock you with flair
          

















    Avoid vague, editorialized, and clickbait titles regardless of source.

    Incomplete, unclear, biased, or leading titles are clickbait. Clickbait and editorialized titles are bad for the community. Please make your titles clear, direct, and neutral.
  
    If you're talking about a car, tell us what it is in the title.
  
    All self-posts must have context. If you're posting a photo of your car, tell us something about it! No direct image links.
  













5



            No political discussion / Code of Conduct
          

















    No political discussion of any sort (discuss policy, not politics). Policy discussions revolve around the concept; political discussions revolve around the individual, party, association, etc. We allow only POLICY discussions, NOT political arguments.
  
    All comments must remain civil and all Redditors are expected to remain courteous.
  
    Slurs, bigoted language, and incitements to violence or criminal behavior will result in an immediate ban.
  













6



            No polls, surveys, petitions, requests for funding
          

















    While r/cars is a good place for discussing cars and car news, we are not the place to go to conduct polls, petitions, or surveys or ask for homework help. Please use r/samplesize or r/homeworkhelp or r/askreddit.
  
    Want to rant? Try r/rant or r/offmychest.
  
r/cars does not allow petitions, begging, contest manipulation, or requests for funding (e.g. gofundme, kickstarter) under any circumstances. This is spam and will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
  













7



            No witch hunts/doxxing
          

















    Doxxing/witch hunting is not okay, not matter how much you think the person, business, or entity deserves it. Please read our stance here.

r/cars is not Consumer Reports or Google Reviews. If you have a complaint against a business/company, please take it up with them directly or see yelp.com.
  
    Posts that exist simply to produce outrage amongst the community may be removed at moderator discretion.
  













8



            Non-member posts
          

















    Presently r/cars does not allow text posts from non-members and may restrict other posts. This greatly reduces "drive-by" and rule-breaking posts by users who are unfamiliar with the rules, practices, and customs of the subreddit. Please read the rules and seek other appropriate subreddits where possible and relevant.
  
    We do not make public the target that one must hit to be considered a member, but the barrier to entry is rather low. If you participate as a regular user you'll have no problems.
  













9



            No car purchase posts
          

















    Join us in the weekly car purchasing sticky that refreshes every Monday morning. All posts pertaining to purchasing or choosing cars will be removed and directed to use that thread. You should also visit r/whatcarshouldibuy and r/askcarsales.
