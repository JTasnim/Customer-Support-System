     Astrology hide and seek? 






    Discussion
  








    I heard abt this a few years back:
  
    The hider hides an item somewhere in the house and marks down the time the item was set, then the seeker figures out it's location using the chart.
  
    Anyone ever played anything like this before or know anything about it? I've played it myself recently and I'm curious about other people experiences or thoughts on it!

    Books & Resources
  








    I just had to tighten up my budget and slash all my paid subscriptions, including some astrological faves. As a result, I am looking for resources/pages/influencers that provide an accurate astrological forecast for cheap.
  
    Not individual-specific stuff--I just enjoy hearing what's going on with the cosmos and how it may affect the general energy. Any thoughts?
  











How does astrology affect those who aren’t doing any self work?

     How does astrology affect those who aren’t doing any self work? 
  





    Beginner
  








    I see all these astrology TikToks for specific signs, but I can’t help but wonder if people are truly affected by astrological events if they aren’t working on themselves.
  
    For example, if such and such astrological event is going to be beneficial for a specific sign, but someone with that sign is just out there doing terrible things, will it still be beneficial for them?
  
    Edited to add: thanks everyone for your thoughtful responses! I think I just get skeptical of takes on astrology that feel very reductive (I.e. Aries, you’re going to have a great month!) and truly appreciate the comments and insight!
