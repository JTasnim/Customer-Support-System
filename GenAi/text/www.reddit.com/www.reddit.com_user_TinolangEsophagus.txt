    Thats just how it works in the Philippines. The only way you would be free of any case is if the family of the “victim” or the victim himself would let you go Like this one. I think the driver here was jailed for few hours or days i cant remember exactly, good thing the family didnt choose to sue

    In cases like this, would the person driving the car be liable or at least put to jail? In my country yes
