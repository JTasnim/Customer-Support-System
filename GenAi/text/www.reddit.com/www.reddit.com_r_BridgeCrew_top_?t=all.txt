     Please overhaul Bridge Crew! I'll give you money! 







    Ubisoft stopped supporting the game a long time ago. It sucks, but it's understandable.  Playable VR was still pretty new and the game was an experiment.  But now, VR is becoming more mainstream, especially since the Quest 2 came out at a price that made it so widely accessible.  More and more people are buying this game completely unaware that it is no longer supported and glitchy as hell on what is by far the most popular VR system.
  
    It's obvious by the gameplay that this game was made by fans, and I love it; but it's past due for an overhaul. It's up to the rest of us to convince developers/publishers that it's worth investing the time and money to make that happen.
  
    Here's what I'd like to see, and would be more than happy to pay for.  Please post your own ideas or just show your support for this thread!
  
    Same basic game structure.  (It works, don't mess with it too much.)
  
    Easier jumping into/out of game.
  
    Absolutely smooth cross-platform gameplay.
  
    Private lobbies that are still open to friends without an invitation. (Maybe on a space station?)
  
    Matchmaking that prioritizes online friends.
  
    More dynamic missions, adding in ship-to-ship diplomacy/negotiation.
  
    Better AI (especially helm).
  
    Bring back and overhaul voice commands for AI.
  
    Optional hand tracking on supported devices.
  
    Abbreviated controls for any station at the Captain's Chair. (Maybe a bit more difficult to use, but essentially functional.)
  
    Free travel outside of missions and random encounters. Accepting hails may lead to unexpected missions!
  
    Endless voyages with the ability to check in at a station once in a while for hull repair or to quit (call it shore leave!).  If you dock at a station mid-mission, the mission fails due to passage of time necessary for hull repair.
  
    Options to enhance/restrict random encounters.  I don't necessarily want to run into the Borg every time I leave spacedock.
  
    More ship classes from the entire franchise; especially NX-01 and Voyager.  Maybe even alien ships.
  
    6 degrees of helm control (or at least add sideways movement).
  
    AAA-level ship models and environments with scalable graphics so as not to exclude those with lower-range hardware.
  
    Less space junk!  In my opinion, the game is too cluttered.  I wouldn't want it to be as empty and boring as actual space, but I think it could be turned down a few notches.
  
    Optional 1st person movement (but don't neglect your station!).
  
HEY UBISOFT!

I WOULD PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME AND A REASONABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE IF IT MEANT CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY FAN INPUT!!!
