     Button Mapping Issue on PSVR2 






    Bug Thread
  








    I finally jumped into PCVR thanks to Sony's price drop and adapter. I bought the game, but I've had trouble making it through the tutorial because one of the basic controls didn't seem to be mapped to the PSVR controllers properly.
  
    Has anyone been able to play this successfully on PSVR2?
  
    This is the only game I've had an issue with so far and I'd love to be able to play with you all.
