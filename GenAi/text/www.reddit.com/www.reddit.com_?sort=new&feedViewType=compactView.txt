     Abortion and society: How far would you go? 



























    This is a hypothetical, not about any scenario for a specific pregnancy, but a question for those PLs here, who have repeatedly expressed and/or tried to explain away or deflect from their blatant disregard for the negative effects of abortion bans for society overall, not just individual pregnant people.
  
    It's also especially for those who repeatedly tell people who can get pregnant to "just don't have sex" or get sterilized if they don't want to.
  
    The PLs I'm talking about have made it exceedingly clear, that they consider the following (I'm sure there are more examples I can't think of right now) to be acceptable or at least preferable outcomes for society overall, just so long as the "mothers" are not allowed to "intentionally kill their babies" and the numbers add up in their mind:
  


    increased maternal and infant mortality rates
  


    increased rates of people becoming infertile from carrying to term pregnancies that are unviable and/or detrimental to their health
  


    increased strain on social security systems by more people being born with disabilities, being orphaned or given up for adoption
  


    increased strain on parents' ability to care for already born children by potentially losing the pregnant parent
  


    increased strain from psychological trauma of people being born only for their parents to see them suffer for hours or days before they pass
  


    increased crime rates from pregnant people not getting away from abusive partners or getting harmed and killed for being pregnant
  


    increased strain on the justice system and traumatic experiences for the people involved by investigation of miscarriages for being possible abortions
  


    possibly extreme overpopulation if every pregnancy was carried to term, no matter what, and if we found solutions to "fix" miscarriages, resulting in even more of the above
  


    Now, I'm not going to argue any of those points with you, as I know you will deny any arbitrary number of them applies to your views, but that's not the point.
  
My question is: How far are you willing to take the general sentiment of "consequences for society can't justify taking a life" in practice?

    Let's say that a considerable number of people actually follows your advice to get sterilized or "just don't have sex", because they're simply terrified of getting pregnant under the laws you're seeking to impose on them:
  
    Would you actually allow society to be crippled for decades or even collapse entirely, if 20, 50, or (almost) 100% of people never had children, one way or another, just to uphold your abstract moral principle of what a "human life" should be worth?
  
    How far would negative consequences need to go, for you to finally acknowledge that some pragmatism may be in order? Or are you just gonna force people to get pregnant, then? What's your solution if your unrealistic expectations for people were actually met?

     Rabbit type commands on Nintendo Switch not working
  


























    I’m trying to get a black and white rabbit (the natural ones from the snowy biome, not Toast). I’ve tried…
  
    /summon rabbit (rabbittype:0-5)
  
    /summon rabbit (type:0-5)
  
    /summon rabbit_type_0-5
  
    Each of these commands summon bunnies, but I just keep getting brown bunnies and black bunnies. Anyone know how to do this?

    Like the title says I’m looking to make a change. I would like something where I can take my skills and utilize them along side engineers developing medical technology/devices.
  
    Does anyone know of career paths or jobs where a bedside RN can successfully get into this field without having to go back to school?
