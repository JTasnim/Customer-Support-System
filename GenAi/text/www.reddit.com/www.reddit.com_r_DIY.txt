Screws from multiple products are snapping off in my plaster walls

     Screws from multiple products are snapping off in my plaster walls 






    help
  








    I’ve got an old house with plaster walls and I’ve now bought two different products from two different companies (one child gate, one set of wall shelves) that came with screws that have snapped off in the wall while using an electric screwdriver/drill. I think I was screwing the shelves into studs, and the child gate was being screwed into a door frame. I drilled pilot holes every time. So I have a few questions:
  
    Am I doing something wrong or are companies just including cheap screws with products now? Do I need to be buying my own higher quality of whatever screws the product needs?
  
    If I’m doing something wrong, what is it? Is the setting on my drill incorrect? Do I need to be going faster/slower with higher/lower torque, etc.?
  
    Then what’s the best way for getting these out of my wall? They are sharp and don’t seem to protrude enough for me to grip them with anything. I’ve bought a nail remover that looks like a specialized version of the claw on the back of a hammer, but I can’t grip them. Do I need to just accept that they’re in my wall now and file these down with a metal file and paint over them?
  
    I’ve mounted dozens of things in various walls over the years but I have failed on both attempts in this new house so I need to figure out what’s going wrong before I further ruin my walls with sharp bits of metal screws protruding everywhere. Feeling really annoyed/defeated by this.
  
    Thanks for your help.

Can I leave plywood planks in my attic on top of insulation?

     Can I leave plywood planks in my attic on top of insulation?
  





    help
  








    I need to do some work in my attic, which is just insulation covering the support beams. The insulation is so thick you can't actually see the beams so I have to feel around with my feet and be really careful about where I step. I've been thinking about cutting some long sheets of plywood to make planks to walk on - and I'm wondering if I can just leave the plywood up there year round rather than taking it down when I'm done? Or will this cause any long term issues? Thanks!

            Rating & Reviewing Products or Brands
          

















    This subreddit has a hard and fast set of rules against rating various manufacturers, and against reviews of products.
  
    In the early days of this sub, we were being hit multiple times a day by accounts that were basically shills. They’d promote various products under the guise of ‘I just used this and it’s great!’ Or they’d trash their competition by saying ‘Hope you don’t have the same experience I had with them’
  
    Therefore we decided that nothing/nobody was going to get rated/promoted.

            Sometimes you let the professionals handle it
          

















    Some things shouldn't be DIY.
  
    Anything where a professional is REQUIRED to perform/complete the task for reasons of :
  


    Safety
  


    Laws / bylaws
  


    Code enforcement
  


    Job Specific Certifications (Master Electrician, etc)
  


    Questions pertaining to these should not be asked in r/DIY. Go ask a professional / get a pro to handle it.
  
    Don't Ask:
  


    Is this?: Dangerous | Mold | Asbestos | etc
  


    If you followed all the codes, laws or are a certified pro who has completed a project, you are free to share.
