    I don't want any employees there to face retaliation but would be happy to DM you more info. Like you, I want to make sure the facts are straight and that's why I had asked a friend who works there to talk to ownership/management to see if there was some missing information. They did and confirmed that this was the case. That was 2 weeks ago which is I guess the time it takes for my righteous anger to make it to reddit.

    It's none of my business whether the owners of these establishments have an agreement between them on how tip money is distributed. But as a consumer I would want to know because a drink tip is so different than a plated meal tip.

Plane taxiing for takeoff. Woman next to me insists on sitting like this. Completely intentional - she got into this position and securely fastened her seatbelt around her ankles. Attendant hasn't noticed. I know she ain't hurting me or anything, I just find her.. mildly infuriating.

    I'm petty enough I would totally do that. But what is this salary you speak of? I'm currently sitting at a whopping $19 /hr even after a year at the company!!
