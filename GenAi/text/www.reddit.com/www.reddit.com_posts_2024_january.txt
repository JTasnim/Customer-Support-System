              PTCM is a hub for sharing above average, planned video camera operation; capturing calculated recording angles; maintaining good camera control, general perception, also properly controlling what's in the frame. 

Interesting content is not necessarily a solid ground for giving praise regardless of how good the content is on its own.

            TIL: Ben Franklin was a slaveowner for much of his life, but after a friend took him to visit a school for black children, he wrote that African ignorance was not inherently natural but came from lack of education, slavery and negative environments. He also petitioned Congress to end slavery.
