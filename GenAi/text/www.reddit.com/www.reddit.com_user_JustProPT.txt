    This applies mostly to prominence 2
  
Experiment with Your Class: Dive into the talent tree early on! Try different builds to find what suits your playstyle best this will make you have more fun on the game
  
Follow the Quests: Engage with the quest system as you play. Completing quests is a great way to earn rewards and learn essential game mechanics, which can really help you progress faster than you normally would if you don't follow the quests!
