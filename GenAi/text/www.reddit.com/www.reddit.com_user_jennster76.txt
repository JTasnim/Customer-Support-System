     Repairing dresser drawer stops/slides 






    help
  








    The plastic drawer stop broke on the back of my dresser drawer and I need to replace it. However, it looks like there are several different slide systems. How would one go about finding out which you have on an older dresser that is no longer available?  This is a broyhill pleasant Isle dresser. I can't seem to find any information about the slide system online.

    Give me one more chance.
  
    I'm not drunk. I just took some medicine.

    That stuffed crust pan always held water after washing it. You had to give it a good whack to get the water out of the hole so it would dry properly

I'm afraid to leave afraid he will lose his job and drink himself to death

    Thank you. I'm lying to you and I'm lying to myself. It's not the only reason I stay. I stay because I still love him. I stay because the few good times are still really good and it hurts to think of not having them anymore.
  
    I hate myself so much for being so weak and such a coward. I can't stand the look in the mirror anymore. I just feel so embarrassed and lost. One minute I tell myself I can handle it and just not let him be responsible for my happiness and take things as they come with him and take care of me whenever he's not around and the next I feel like I deserve so much better and I don't know why I do this anymore.

    Today is my birthday. We were supposed to spend the day together and it started off good but around 10:00 when the liquor stores open he decided he had to do laundry which I knew he did. I can't make him stay nor will I try. It's almost 5:00 and I haven't heard from him since. I'm supposed to have a family dinner tonight at 7:30 and don't know if he'll even make that.
  
    I just feel so dead inside and if he wasn't good when he was good it would be easy but it's never that cut and dried is it?
  
    I didn't even know what to tag this. Is it a vent? Do I need support? He's relapsed so there's that. So pick your poison.

Update: AITAH for calling my sister a lazy leech after she demanded I babysit her kids EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND?

    Yes that was a stroke of genius. I was going to point op to that thread and tell her just to start making a schedule for everyone that is so concerned about sister having free time.
  
    It's easy to want to utilize someone else's time, but when it's their own they might see things differently.
